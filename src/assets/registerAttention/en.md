Before registering, you need to pay attention to the followings.

1. Your password will be **ENCRYPTED** and stored on my server without anyone (including me) being able to decrypt it.

2. HTTPS connection is enforced (thank you Azure and Cloudflare). Secure transmission is guaranteed.

3. For visitors, account is used only when commenting and liking an article. More may be added in the future.
