Before registering, you need to pay attention to the followings.

1. Your password will be **ENCRYPTED** and stored on my server without anyone (including me) being able to decrypt it.

2. Despite the unsecured HTTP connection (since I can't afford a server), your password will first be **IRREVERSIBLY PROCESSED** (How? Find it out yourself :D) locally and then send through Internet. Even when hackers intercepted your Internet connection, they could not get the original password. There is no need to worry about security.

3. Currently for visitors, account is used only when commenting and liking an article. More may be added in the future.

4. I promise that I will **NEVER** leak account info intentionally.

5. Password recovery is not available for now, so remember your password.

6. Server and database may change **frequently** and **without advance notification**. Your account info may be lost at any time.

Please read the above carefully. Thank you.
